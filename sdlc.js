// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design 
// Implementation
// Testing
// Maintain 


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
// const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
// const analysisOfRequirements = "Gathering maximum information from the client requirements for the product"
// const design = "The program developer scrutinizes whether the prepared software suffices all the requirements of the end-user"
// const implementation = "It means translating the design to a computer-legible language."
// const testing = "The testing team tests the functionality of the entire system"
// const maintain = "The developed product is taken care of here to fix any issues that mauy arise or any updates needed."
